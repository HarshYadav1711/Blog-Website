Users access websites from smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers, each with different screen sizes and capabilities.</p><h2>Mobile-First Approach</h2><p>The mobile-first approach means designing for the smallest screen first, then progressively enhancing the experience for larger screens. This ensures that your website works well on all devices.</p><pre><code>/* Mobile styles first */\n.container {\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n\n/* Tablet styles */\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  .container {\n    max-width: 750px;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Desktop styles */\n@media (min-width: 1024px) {\n  .container {\n    max-width: 1200px;\n  }\n}</code></pre><h2>Flexible Grid Systems</h2><p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful tools for creating responsive layouts. They allow you to create flexible, maintainable layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.</p><p>Key principles of responsive design include:</p><ul><li>Flexible grids and layouts</li><li>Responsive images and media</li><li>CSS media queries</li><li>Touch-friendly navigation</li><li>Performance optimization</li></ul>",

    "content": "<p>JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, and ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced many features that have become essential for modern web development.</p><h2>Arrow Functions</h2><p>Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions:</p><pre><code>// Traditional function\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n// Arrow function\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b;</code></pre><h2>Template Literals</h2><p>Template literals make string interpolation much easier:</p><pre><code>const name = 'World';\nconst greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;</code></pre><h2>Destructuring</h2><p>Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects:</p><pre><code>// Array destructuring\nconst [first, second] = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// Object destructuring\nconst {name, age} = {name: 'John', age: 30};</code></pre><h2>Promises and Async/Await</h2><p>Modern JavaScript provides better ways to handle asynchronous operations:</p><pre><code>// Using async/await\nasync function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    return data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error:', error);\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>These features make JavaScript more powerful and enjoyable to work with. Start incorporating them into your projects today!</p>",
